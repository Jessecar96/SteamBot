# CSGO Win Big Steam Bot

### What is this?
This is a custom fork of [Jessecar96/SteamBot](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot), for handling deposit and payout trade offers for [CSGO Win Big](http://csgowinbig.com/). CSGO Win Big is a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive jackpot skin betting website, created by me, Jordan Turley.

**SteamBot** is a bot written in C# for the purpose of interacting with Steam Chat and Steam Trade.  As of right now, about 8 contributors have all added to the bot.  The bot is publicly available under the MIT License. Check out [LICENSE] for more details.

There are several things you must do in order to get SteamBot working:

1. Download the source.
2. Compile the source code.
3. Install and configure the bot (username, password, etc.). These steps are lined out [here](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/wiki/Installation-Guide)
 * Be sure to set "BotControlClass" to "SteamBot.DepositTradeOfferUserHandler".
4. This project requires that you have Json.NET from Newtonsoft, so you will have to add this, probably through NuGet.
5. Download the code for the website [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig), and upload it to a server, and set it up, making sure that it is functional.
6. Change the url [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot/blob/master/SteamBot/DepositTradeOfferUserHandler.cs#L132) to your own website's check-items.php php script.
7. Change the url [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot/blob/master/SteamBot/DepositTradeOfferUserHandler.cs#L162) to your own website's deposit php script.
7. Change the url [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot/blob/master/SteamBot/DepositTradeOfferUserHandler.cs#L200) to your own bot's inventory url. Just replace the number after 'profiles/' and before '/inventory' to your bot's 64bit ID. This can be found pretty easily on https://steamid.io/.
8. Once you have the website set up, you should have a file in your web root with your default password. Make a text file named 'password.txt' on your desktop (or wherever you want) with only this password in it. Then, update the location of this file [here](https://github.com/ztizzlegaming/CSGOWinBig-SteamBot/blob/master/SteamBot/DepositTradeOfferUserHandler.cs#L85).

### Getting the Source

Retrieving the source code should be done by following the [installation guide] on the wiki. The install guide covers the instructions needed to obtain the source code as well as the instructions for compiling the code.

### Configuring the Bot

See the [configuration guide] on the wiki. This guide covers configuring a basic bot as well as creating a custom user handler.

### Bot Administration

While running the bots you may find it necessary to do some basic operations like shutting down and restarting a bot. The console will take some commands to allow you to do some this. See the [usage guide] for more information.

### Troubleshooting
* If you are trying to get this website set up and encounter any errors, please send me an email at support@csgowinbig.com. DO NOT submit an issue, only submit an issue if there is something legitimately wrong with the code. Also, please try something on your own before messaging me, and if you cannot fix it on your own, send me an email and list off what you have tried. If you haven't tried anything, I will not respond.
* Please DO NOT add me on Steam, just sned an email to the support email.
* If you are getting a 500 Internal Server Error when trying to send/receive a trade offer, this is probably because it has not been 7 days since you have first logged in on the bot. Steam puts a 7 day trade ban on your account when you login on a new device, so you must wait 7 days before sending or receiving trades on the bot once you first login.

**SteamTradeOffersBot** is a fork of [SteamBot](https://github.com/Jessecar96/SteamBot/), with an easy-to-use Trade Offers library and a true generic inventory interface, written by waylaidwanderer. All code related to live trading have been removed for simplicity. The bot is publicly available under the MIT License. Check out [LICENSE] for more details.

There are several things you must do in order to get SteamBot working:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Fetch submodules.
3. Compile the bot (update/reinstall nuget packages if necessary).
4. Configure the bot (username, password, etc.).
5. *Optionally*, customize the bot by changing the source code.

## Getting the Source

Retrieving the source code should be done by following the [installation guide] on the wiki. The install guide covers the instructions needed to obtain the source code as well as the instructions for compiling the code.

## Configuring the Bot

See the [configuration guide] on the wiki. This guide covers configuring a basic bot as well as creating a custom user handler.

## Bot Administration

While running the bots you may find it necessary to do some basic operations like shutting down and restarting a bot. The console will take some commands to allow you to do some this. See the [usage guide] for more information.
